# Matlab Bag

A website that contains files and videos which explain Matlab software easily and simply.

## Tools

[Nuxt.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework

## Note

I used Nuxt.js because it has nice features and an easy way of routing and implementing a database and server app if the customer wants to add a database feature.
