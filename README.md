# Matlab Bag

A [website](https://matlab-bag.vercel.app/) that contains files and videos which explain Matlab software easily and simply.

## Tools

1. [Nuxt.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework
2. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) For hosting

## Note

I used Nuxt.js because it has nice features and an easy way of routing and implementing a database and server app if the customer wants to add a database feature.
